# Student Pie Chart

This is a full stack application that receives information about courses,
instructors and student numbers and demonstrates said information on the
front end.

This application uses a Node.js backend to serve the information and React
on the front end. Google charts was used to showcase the PieChart.

### How to Use

Clone the repo, npm install and then npm start to run the application
(If you make changes on the front end you'll also need to run a webpack watch).

Go to http://localhost:3000/ to see the application and once the chart is
loaded click on one of the portions to display a table of instructors within
that course.
